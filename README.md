## Open source

This extension is open source and doesn't collect any information from users. It's free, and made available because I
like making useful things for the web. Please consider contributing with an idea, bug fix, or feature request.

## Local development

Before making edits you will need to build the extension locally and side load it as a developer extension to test any
changes.

#### 1. Clone the repo Clone the repo to your local machine and navigate into the root directory.

```shell
cd link-roamer
```

#### 2. Install dependencies SVG Gobbler uses yarn to build the necessary dependencies.

```shell
yarn
```

#### 3. Start and watch a build

For development with automatic reloading:

```bazaar
yarn start 
```

This will build to the `dist` folder. To load the extension, open the Extensions Dashboard, enable "Developer mode",
click "Load unpacked", and choose the `dist` folder.

When you make changes in src the background script and any content script will reload automatically.
